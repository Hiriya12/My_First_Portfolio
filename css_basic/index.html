    <p> With the 1993 secession of Eritrea, </p>
        its former province along the Red Sea, Ethiopia became landlocked.</p> 
       <p>Ethiopia is one of the world’s oldest countries, its territorial extent having varied over the millennia of its existence. 
        In ancient times it remained centred on Aksum, an imperial capital located in the northern part of the modern state, 
        about 100 miles (160 km) from the Red Sea coast. 
        The present territory was consolidated during the 19th and 20th centuries as European powers encroached into Ethiopia’s historical domain.  </p>
       <p> Ethiopia became prominent in modern world affairs first in 1896, 
        when it defeated colonial Italy in the Battle of Adwa, 
        and again in 1935–36, when it was invaded and occupied by fascist Italy.</p>
         <p> Ethiopia is bounded by Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the east, 
            Kenya to the south, and South Sudan and Sudan to the west</p>
